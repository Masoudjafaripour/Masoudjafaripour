## Hi, I'm Masoud

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Alberta, focused on multimodal vision-language generative models. My research interests lie at the intersection of planning, reasoning, and grounded decision-making for intelligent systems, with a particular focus on advancing the capabilities of large multimodal language models (MMLMs).
